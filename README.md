# SOLAR-ENERGY

“Developed a responsive Solar Energy informational website using HTML and CSS. The project showcases different types of solar panels, their benefits, working principles, and environmental impact. Designed clean layouts, organized content sections, and used CSS flexbox/grid to create a modern, visually appealing interface. Implemented responsive design for mobile and tablet screens to enhance user experience. The project demonstrates my ability to structure web content, apply styling techniques, and create an engaging, user-friendly website without using JavaScript.”
